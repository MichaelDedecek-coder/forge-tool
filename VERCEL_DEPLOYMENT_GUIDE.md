3. **Add these 6 variables:**

#### Required Variables:

**Supabase Configuration:**

Environment: Production, Preview, Development
```

```

### Step 2: Trigger Deployment

**Option A: Push to Main Branch (Automatic Deployment)**
```bash
# Merge your feature branch to main
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge claude/update-resume-Cky79
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy when you push to main.

**Option B: Manual Deployment in Vercel Dashboard**
1. Go to: https://vercel.com/michaeldedecek-coder/forge-tool
2. Click: Deployments
3. Find: `claude/update-resume-Cky79` branch
4. Click: "Deploy"
5. Select: Production

---

### Step 3: Test Feedback Button

Once deployed (takes 2-3 minutes):

1. **Visit:** https://datawizard.forgecreative.cz/datawizard (or your production URL)
2. **Look for:** Green feedback button in bottom-left corner
3. **Click it** → Modal should open
4. **Fill out form:**
   - Type: Bug Report
   - Message: "Test from production deployment"
   - Email: michael@forgecreative.cz
5. **Submit**
6. **Check email:** You should receive formatted email within 10 seconds
7. **Check Supabase:** Go to Table Editor → feedback table → Should see new entry

## ❌ TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Build Fails:

1. **Check:** Vercel build logs
2. **Look for:** Missing environment variables
3. **Fix:** Add missing variables in Vercel dashboard
4. **Redeploy:** Click "Redeploy" button

### If Button Doesn't Appear:

1. **Open:** Browser DevTools (F12)
2. **Check:** Console tab for errors
3. **Look for:** React hydration errors or JavaScript errors
4. **Report:** Send screenshot to Claude Code

### If Email Doesn't Arrive:

1. **Check:** Spam folder
2. **Check:** Supabase feedback table (data should still be saved)
3. **Check:** Vercel function logs for email errors
4. **Verify:** Resend API key is correct

### If Database Insert Fails:

1. **Check:** Supabase logs in dashboard
2. **Verify:** RLS policies are correct
3. **Test:** Try with authenticated user vs anonymous

## 📊 POST-DEPLOYMENT MONITORING

### First 24 Hours:

- [ ] Check Vercel analytics for page views
- [ ] Monitor Supabase feedback table for submissions
- [ ] Check email inbox for test notifications
- [ ] Review Vercel function logs for errors
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test in different browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox)

### Week 1:

- [ ] Review feedback submissions
- [ ] Respond to user feedback (if any)

## 🚨 ROLLBACK PLAN

If everything breaks:

1. **Go to:** Vercel → Deployments
2. **Find:** Previous successful deployment
3. **Click:** Three dots menu → "Promote to Production"
4. **Done:** Site reverts to previous version

Feedback feature is **additive** - removing it won't break existing functionality.
